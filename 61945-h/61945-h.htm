<i>LESSON II</i><br />

Controlled Breathing as a Means of
Exercise</h2></div>


<p>Many theories concerning the art of
breathing have been exploited in recent
years. Numerous books dealing with the
subject have been offered to the public.
The net results, however, have been unsatisfactory.
The appeal of this propaganda
has met with comparatively little
response. The truth as to the importance
of right method in breathing
may have been presented, but it has remained
valueless, since it has not been
accepted and acted upon by those to
whom it was addressed. Perhaps in
great measure the fault lies in the fact
that the various advocates of breath-systems
have been too vague in their
teachings, have expounded the theory
rather than the practice.</p>

<p>It is for this reason that I have been
at pains to describe all necessary exercises
in such detail as to make the practice
of them simple and easy for every
reader, I have arranged them in such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
order as to make sure a rapid progress
toward perfect breath-control, with its
consequent increase in health, beauty,
efficiency and happiness.</p>

<p>It seems, indeed, difficult to impress
on anybody not familiar with the wonderful
advantages of correct breathing,
a full recognition of the vital bearing
breath-control has on the well-being of
the individual. Air is too ridiculously
cheap to be much respected by most persons.
And, too, breathing is ordinarily
automatic, requiring no thought. Naturally
enough, then, most persons give
it no attention, since they have no realization
of its importance.</p>

<p>Nature has provided that all great
things should be essentially simple. It
is thus with the process of breathing,
which is the chief vital functioning of
the body.</p>

<p>An ancient philosopher has said:</p>

<p>&#8220;The more we desire to have that
which is superfluous, the more we meet
with difficulties; the more necessary the
thing is for living beings, the more
easily it is found and the cheaper it is:
air, water and food are indispensable
to man. Air is most necessary, for if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
man is without air a few moments he
dies, whilst he can be without water a
day or longer. Air is undoubtedly found
more easily and is cheaper than water.
Water is more necessary than food, and
is proportionately cheaper; and so on, as
to the different kinds of food and luxuries.&#8221;</p>

<p>Note well the undeniable fact as asserted
by the philosopher, that air is of
the first importance.</p>

<p>If air had to be paid for, or if only a
very limited amount were to be distributed
to each consumer, there would be
an instant and universal recognition of
its supreme value. Its restriction would
compel every individual to appreciate
the unique worth of the true Elixir of
Life.</p>


<h3>What Mortality Statistics Teach Us</h3>

<p>According to statistics of the United
States census, the annual death rate
from all causes is one million. Of this
number, four hundred thousand died
from diseases of the lungs. The figures
demonstrate that two persons, at least
out of every five, come to their death<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
prematurely&mdash;and from a preventable
cause.</p>

<p>Another aspect of the truth is gaining
wider recognition day by day throughout
the civilized world. This has to do
with the appreciation of fresh air as a
fundamental of health. There has been
a remarkable awakening to this effect
within a generation. Today, the preferred
treatment of consumptives demands
that they shall live out of doors
if possible; the windows in the hospitals
are seldom closed; sleeping porches are
built wherever space permits.</p>

<p>It is unfortunately true, however, that
there has been little advancement in
general knowledge as to the science, the
art, and practice of correct breathing.
Yet, I have been surprised and gratified
by the eager attention of those friends
to whom I have made explanations and
given exhibitions during the last few
years. Without an exception, these
friends have manifested a keen desire
to learn the secrets of breath-control and
to win for themselves the benefits thus
conferred.</p>

<p>In order to broaden my knowledge
and to render it exact, I have made serious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
studies and experiments through a
term of years. I am convinced that if,
instead of gymnasiums, institutions
were established for training in the development
of breath-control, the grim
death-toll of one million for one year in
our country would dwindle amazingly.</p>


<h3>The Gymnastics of Breathing</h3>

<p>You must always remember that the
correct carriage of the body during the
period of the breathing exercises is a
factor of great importance, since the
lungs function variously in accordance
with different postures of the body.</p>

<p>After the fundamental principles of
deep breathing are mastered, the next
step is to connect it with different exercises,
respectively, of the arms, the legs,
the trunk, and the head. At first it will
be found somewhat difficult to combine
attention to the various parts concerned,
but the ability to do this will be readily
mastered by practice.</p>

<p>The point involved is that the muscles
of the chest have a reflex action on other
muscles. For instance, when the lungs
are full of air all the cells are inflated to
the utmost, the chest is stretched, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
diaphragm is drawn down. The various
muscles of the chest, of the back and of
the abdomen are in a state of high tension.
This tension should last only during
the time in which the breath is held.
Moreover, care must be taken that it
shall not influence any other muscles besides
those directly concerned.</p>

<p>When you exercise the arms rhythmically
while the breath is being held,
such movement of the arms must not be
permitted to influence the breath. The
result to be striven for is an intelligent
control of the muscles, so that the various
groups shall be made to act independently.
Every school of gymnastics
seeks to attain the same end&mdash;with a
difference: In this system of breath-control,
the lungs are trained&mdash;the chief
requisite for all health, beauty and
vigor.</p>

<p>And now that we have given this
much of attention to the &#8220;Why?&#8221; let us
go forward to the &#8220;How?&#8221; of breath-control.</p>


<h3>Preparation for the Exercises</h3>

<p>The clothing should be loose, especially
around the neck and chest. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
advisable, when convenient, that the collar
should be removed for the duration
of the exercises. The buttons of the
coat and vest, too, should be unfastened.
(After a short time it will be found that
these buttons must be placed nearer the
edges of the garments.)</p>

<p>The girl or woman who wishes to get
the best results from these exercises
should be sure to have no clothing on
that may bind her about the waist, constrict
her diaphragm, or press upon her
abdominal muscles.</p>

<p>It is almost superfluous to say that
she should never attempt her exercises
without, at least, first divesting herself
of her corset&mdash;if she wears corsets. It
is better to wear merely the comfortable
union suit that so many sensible girls and
women now wear. For this affords perfect
freedom of movement and permits
every muscle to be properly tensed and
relaxed by the deep breathing exercises,
and the gymnastic movements that accompany
them.</p>

<p>The first requirement throughout all
the exercises is a preliminary releasing
from the lungs of the old, dead air,
which is a continual source of self-poisoning.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
This accumulation must be
driven out from the points of the lungs
before the new breath is taken. It is
repeated also on the conclusion of all
the exercises. It must never be neglected.</p>


<h3>The Cleansing Breath</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Explanation In Detail</span></p>

<p>This exercise prefaces and ends every
exercise in breathing. By prefacing an
exercise, it makes space in the lungs for
a capacity volume of new breath; by
ending an exercise, it serves the important
function of relaxing the whole
body. It should be studied very carefully.</p>

<p>Exhale (blow out) energetically, saying
&#8220;ss&#8221; between the teeth. Exaggerate
the hissing sound of &#8220;s&#8221;. This protects the
throat. While doing this, bring shoulders
and head forward as in Photograph
1 (a). This helps to press out that air
which is never entirely removed from
the lungs. We call this the residual air.</p>

<p>After exhaling all you can, begin the
second part of this exercise by doing the
opposite. Inhale slowly through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
nose, gradually bringing the out-stretched
arms overhead, performing a
circle; also bring head and shoulders
back, filling the lungs in all parts to
great capacity. See Photograph 1 (b).
Pause for one or two seconds, and relax
suddenly. This is difficult to do correctly.
To relax suddenly means to relax
with a crash&mdash;the breath escapes at
once, the arms fall, the knees bend and
all this must take place together. With
well-opened mouth you say &#8220;Ha!&#8221; to
help make the breath escape quickly.</p>

<p>This very important sudden relaxation
may lack snap and precision at first,
but after a few days the mind will become
trained to its action. After this
relaxation take two shorter breaths in
the same way then pause before repeating.</p>


<h3>The Cleansing Breath</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">In Condensed Form</span></p>

<p>Position: Erect, with arms at side.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<div class="hangingindent">
<p>(a) Exhale (blow out) quickly, saying
&#8220;ss.&#8221; See Photograph 1 (a).</p>

<p>(b) Inhale through nose, lifting arms to
front.</p>

<p>(c) Hold breath as in position, Photograph
1 (b).</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>(d) Exhale suddenly &#8220;Ha,&#8221; bringing arms
down to sides.</p>

<p>(e) Two short cleansing breaths. Pause
ten seconds before repeating.</p></div></div>

<p>Ordinarily, do this exercise six to
eight times, with pauses between.</p>


<h3>The Short Controlled Breath</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Explanation In Detail</span></p>

<p>Exhale first as shown in Photograph 1
(the cleansing breath). This precedes
every exercise.</p>

<p>After the cleansing breath, inhale
through the nose, while placing the
hands lightly on hips, as in Photograph
2. Hold the breath a few seconds and
open the mouth. Do not permit any
breath to escape. The opening of the
mouth proves to yourself that there is
no contraction at the throat; instead,
the diaphragm is holding the breath.
Now, exhale, saying &#8220;ss&#8221; between the
teeth, with relaxed throat. It is very
important to observe that the chest is
held high for the first half of expiration.
Then let it quickly sink with the breath,
and take two or three quick cleansing
breaths.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>Observe that the shoulders do not rise
while inhaling&mdash;that you really inhale,
not that you stretch the chest muscles
and lift the shoulders, as I have seen
even athletes do, when asked to take a
deep breath. Besides opening the mouth
during the period of held breath, it
would be well to turn the neck several
times to prove its freedom from tension.</p>


<h3>The Short Controlled Breath</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">In Condensed Form</span></p>

<p>Position: Erect, with arms at sides.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<div class="hangingindent">
<p>(a) Exhale as in Exercise One, saying
&#8220;ss.&#8221;</p>

<p>(b) Inhale through nose, placing hands
on hips as in Photograph 2.</p>

<p>(c) Hold breath one to four seconds;
open mouth.</p>

<p>(d) Exhale &#8220;ss&#8221; first holding chest high,
then letting it sink slowly with
breath.</p>

<p>(e) Two to three cleansing breaths. Pause
before repeating.</p></div></div>

<p>To be done five or six times with
pauses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>


<h3>The Climax Breath</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Explanation In Detail</span></p>

<p>This exercise is the most difficult of
all breathing gymnastics, and should not
be attempted by the sick. It requires
great endurance. Even an athlete
should not attempt it, until the others
are well in hand.</p>

<p>The first part is exactly like the exercise
marked &#8220;The Short Controlled
Breath.&#8221; But in the second part, instead
of expelling the air suddenly, you proceed
to exhale very slowly (after holding
the breath a few seconds). Care
should be taken to see that the upper
chest is held high as long as possible
while exhaling. With the last atom of
breath leaving the lungs, drop (relax)
the shoulders and whole frame. Quickly take
two or three more cleansing
breaths to quiet the heart and lungs.</p>

<p>When one is ready for this strenuous
exercise, it becomes a great force for
building breadth and depth to the chest,
and new inner vitality.</p>

<p>During the first few weeks one performance
of this exercise is enough for the
day. After the second month, two exercises<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
per day, fifth month, three exercises
per day, etc., very gradually increasing
the number.</p>


<h3>The Climax Breath</h3>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">In Condensed Form</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<div class="hangingindent">
<p>(a) Exhale &#8220;ss.&#8221;</p>

<p>(b) Inhale slowly. &#8220;Hiss&#8221; through smallest
opening of lips and closed teeth.
Place hands on diaphragm, as in Photograph
3.</p>

<p>(c) Hold breath several seconds.</p>

<p>(d) Exhale slowly &#8220;ss&#8221; through small
opening of lips and teeth.</p>

<p>(e) Several cleaning breaths. <b>Long</b> pause.</p></div></div>

<p>This is never to be performed more than
twice at one time, during the first two
months.</p>

<p>With girls or women who are inclined
to stoutness, it may sometimes be well
to place the hands immediately under
the busts&mdash;slightly supporting the
breasts&mdash;instead of on the hips.</p>

<p>It will be found that the &#8220;relaxing&#8221;
movements can thus be performed with
more comfort&mdash;until such time as the
muscles supporting the busts gain in
strength and elasticity.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>Care should be taken at first not to
take in too much breath, nor to hold the
breath too long. This matter, however,
is entirely individual. Naturally, a
greater amount of care must be exercised
by a delicate child or by a consumptive
than by a healthy youth.</p>

<p>And right here it should be emphasized
that, if you are a business man,
sitting for long hours every day at a
desk, you should, in order to derive the
maximum amount of good from these
breathing exercises, plan to stand up,
near the open window and spend a few
minutes practicing some of these simple
exercises.</p>

<p>You will often find that what you
thought was the fatigue of overwork is
nothing more or less than staying too
long in a close atmosphere, and making
an insufficient use of your organs of respiration.</p>

<p>The feeling of freshness these exercises
will impart, the increased vigor and
the enhanced clearness of mind that will
come to you, will prove a grateful source
of surprise.</p>

<p>Many men, formerly in the habit of
visiting for a cocktail, take a few deep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
breaths in this scientific manner. They
claim that this Fresh Air Cocktail is better
than any coffee or liquor stimulant.
And it can be certain that nothing but
good effects can ever follow it.</p>

<p>By this system of breathing you can
build up a wonderful physique. You can
become strong and active, and have a
superabundance of health and vitality&mdash;and
without spending more than a few
minutes a day at your breathing exercises.
After a short time the <i>habit</i> for
slow, deep breathing is formed, and as
with all habits, it requires no attention
whatsoever.</p>


<h3>Hints for Controlled Breathing</h3>

<p>It should go almost without saying
that to get the <i>best</i> effects from air you
should breathe the purest air obtainable.</p>

<p>Air which is full of dust particles, for
instance, may be actually irritating to
the delicate mucous membrane that lines
the nose, throat, bronchial tubes and air
cells of the lungs.</p>

<p>This dust contains particles of organic
matter derived from the excrement of
horses and dogs, from dried atoms of offal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
and decaying vegetable matter, or
from dried mud impregnated with urine.</p>

<p>Indeed, it is very largely upon these
particles that the micro-organisms&mdash;arch
enemies of mankind as well as of
animal kind&mdash;are carried on their errand
of destruction.</p>

<p>These micro-organisms are most
abundant in the air of inhabited rooms&mdash;and
the more people in the room the
greater the number of microbes present.</p>

<p>So don&#8217;t be afraid of open windows&mdash;day
or night. Remember Florence
Nightingale&#8217;s quaint observation, &#8220;Windows
are made to be opened.&#8221;</p>


<h3>Always Breathe Through the Nose</h3>

<p>It should be remembered, also, that so
far as possible, all inhalation of air
should be through the nose. This is for
two very important reasons.</p>

<p>First, the fine hairs lining the nasal
passages act as a sieve through which
the inspired air is strained.</p>

<p>Further than this the lower turbinated
bodies in the nose, and the lower half of
the middle turbinates are covered with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
tiny cells (ciliated tissue) protruding
from the membrane covering of the turbinates.</p>

<p>These cells catch and hold any particles
of dust or other matter that may
have slipped through the hair screen of
the nostrils. Thus dust, germs and
other harmful material are removed
from the air currents, and prevented
from reaching the lung cells.</p>

<p>The next most important reason is
that the chambers of the nose, with
their wonderfully rich blood supply, act
as temperature regulators.</p>

<p>If you breathe air at zero temperature
through the nose it is actually warmed
to body temperature before it passes into
the bronchial tubes.</p>

<p>If you were to breathe desert air, or
the air of a blast furnace heated to 130
degrees&mdash;this superheated air would be
cooled approximately to body temperature
before it was passed into the lung
cells.</p>

<p>If there is a tendency to breathe
through the mouth, this will be manifested
most decidedly at night, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
you are asleep, and the muscles are relaxed.</p>

<p>If you find that you are in the habit
of sleeping with the mouth open&mdash;awakening
in the morning with a dry, harsh
throat, it might be well to adopt the device
which Dr. William H. Fitzgerald
introduced to the medical profession almost
20 years ago.</p>

<p>This consists merely in applying a
small piece of surgeon&#8217;s adhesive plaster
over the closed lips, keeping them closed
during all the hours of the night.</p>

<p>The court-plaster can be applied
lengthwise over the lips; or it can be
pasted across the lips, holding them
firmly in the closed position. Many find
the latter method the most practical.</p>

<p>The more fresh air you can get in your
home, your office or school or workshop,
or wherever you may have to spend your
day time&mdash;the better off you&#8217;ll be.</p>
